				Renaissance artists used symbolic objects to communicate with an audience that was largely illiterate. During the Victorian era, the cypress with its dark branches and tall columnar shape was a symbol of the cemetery and death and was widely planted in European as well as Middle Eastern graveyards. In the ‘Starry Night’ Van Gogh invoked the above symbolism.
