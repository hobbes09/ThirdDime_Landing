						<h3>Artists are historians and their art the journal. Undeniably, art is not only an expression of beauty and creativity; it is also a reflection of the times.Events such as war impact artists even deeper. <br/>
		The first painting is by Picasso where he depicts a massacre during the Korean war.<br/>
		The second painting is by Otto Dix which represents a ruthless class struggle taking place in Germany.<br/>
		The third painting is by Goya where he presents a scene from the Peninsular war.<br/>
		The fourth painting is by Manet depicting the execution of Maximillian by a firing squad.<br/>
		Goya's painting is the original inspiration.
